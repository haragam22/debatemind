Abstract  — Telomeres —the chromosomal end -caps that safeguard genomic integrity —shorten progressively 
with age and are profoundly influenced by lifestyle and environmental exposures. This study investigates how 
disparities in lifestyle -driven factors across Indian sta tes contribute to telomere attrition, effectively creating a 
“Telomere Divide” across the nation. Focusing on three key determinants —tobacco use, obesity prevalence, and 
ambient PM 2.5 pollution levels —we developed a weighted, evidence -backed mod el to evaluate each state’s 
relative telomere health risk. States were then ranked based on their cumulative scores, revealing stark variations 
in biological aging patterns shaped by socio -environmental conditions. The analysis highlights how certain 
regio ns face accelerated aging risks due to a convergence of high pollutant exposure and unhealthy lifestyle 
habits, while others benefit from more favo urable health and environmental conditions. By mapping these 
disparities, this study not only underscores the  critical role of lifestyle in cellular aging but also calls for targeted 
public health strategies to bridge the telomere gap and promote equitable aging outcomes across India.

I. Introduction  
 
I.I Telomeres & Agin g 
Aging is a complex, multifactorial biological process influenced not only by genetics but also 
profoundly shaped by lifestyle and environmental  factors.  [1] 
At the heart of this biological aging lies a crucial molecular component: the telomere —the repetitive 
nucleotide sequences (TTAGGG in humans) found at the ends of linear chromosomes. These 
structures serve as protective caps that prevent chromosomal frayin g and fusion during cell division.  
[2,3].  Each time a somatic cell divides, a portion of its telomeric DNA is lost due to the “end -
replication problem,” a limitation of DNA polymerase  [4]. Over time, this progressive telomere 
shortening —also known as telomere attrition —leads to critically short telomeres, triggering cellular 
senescence, apoptosis, or genomic  instability  (Refer to Fig.1)  [5,6] .

 In essence, telomere length is a molecular clock of cellular aging, and its rate of attrition reflects the 
pace at which the body is biologically aging  [2]. While telomere shortening is a natural consequence 
of cellular replication, various external and internal factors can accelerate or decelerate this process,  
[1,7]  creating disparities in biological aging among populations that may otherwise appear similar in 
chronological  age. 
 
I.II Telomere Attrition and its Co rrelation with  the Lifestyle F actors  
Telomere attrition refers to the rate at which telomeres shorten over time. Although genetically 
inherited telomere length varies between individuals, it is profoundly affected by environmental and 
lifestyle factors  [8]. Inflammation and oxidative stress are two major pathways that accelerate 
telomere shortening, and both are significantly influenced by how we live  [7,9]. Thus, lifestyle is not 
just a behavio ural choice —it becomes a molecular determinant  of health span . 
Emerging studies across different populations have shown that telomere length is correlated with 
several lifestyle behavio urs and exposures.  These  include:  
1. Air Pollution: Chronic exposure to air pollutants, particularly fine particulate matter (PM 2.5), 
nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), and ozone (O₃), has been shown to induce oxidative DNA damage 
and systemic inflammation. These pollutants can penetrate the bloodstream via alveolar 
exchange, affecting multiple organs and contributing to telomere attrition  [10,11] . Urban 
populations exposed to poor air quality consistently show reduced leukocyte telomere 
length, highlighting air pollution as a critical environmental determinant of biological  aging.  
2. Tobacco Use: Tobacco consumption is a major modifiable risk factor contributing to 
increased oxidative stress and inflammation, both of which accelerate telomere shortening. 
Several epidemiological studies have demonstrated that smokers have significantly shorter 
telomeres compared to non -smokers of the same chronological age  [12,13] . The oxidative 
compounds in cigarette smoke damage DNA and impair telomerase activity, thereby 
hastening cellular aging. The dose -response relationship indicates that telomere length 
decreases with the number of cigarettes smoked per day and the duration of 
smoking  history.  Pollution and Environmental Exposure: Air pollution —particularly 
exposure to PM 2.5, heavy metals, and industrial pollutants —can induce systemic 
inflammation, contributing significantly to telomere attrition.  
3. Obesity: Obesity is associated with increased systemic inflammation and elevated oxidative 
stress levels, both known drivers of telomere attrition. Adipose tissue, particularly visceral 
fat, produces pro -inflammatory cytokines like IL -6 and TNF -α, which ha ve been implicated 
in telomere shortening  [8,14] . Research suggests that individuals with higher body mass 
index (BMI) tend to have shorter telomeres, and the effect is more pronounced in younger 
age groups, indicating early cellular aging. Moreover, obesi ty-related metabolic 
dysfunctions such as insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia  further exacerbate  telomere  loss. 
Socio -economic and Public Health Indicators: Access to healthcare, sanitation, education, 
and nutritional support indirectly impact telomere biology by shaping lifestyle and disease 
prevalence.  
4. Psychological Stress : Psychological stress, both acute and chronic, has a substantial impact 
on telomere biology. Activation of the hypothalamic -pituitary -adrenal (HPA) axis in 
response to stress elevates cortisol levels, which in turn suppress telomerase activity and 
promote o xidative damage. Numerous studies have associated high levels of perceived 
stress, trauma, and caregiving burden with significantly shorter telomeres  [9,15] . 
Furthermore, stress -related behavio urs such as poor sleep, substance use, an d physical 
inactivity further compound the effects of psychological distress on telomere  length.

5. Dietary Patterns:  Nutrition plays a central role in modulating oxidative stress and 
inflammation —key mechanisms behind telomere shortening  [16,17] . Diets rich in processed 
meats, refined sugars, and saturated fats are associated with increased telomere attrition, 
whereas antioxidant -rich diets such as the Mediterranean diet (comprising fruits, vegetables, 
whole grains, legumes, nuts, olive oil, and fish) are correlated with longer telomeres. 
Micronutrients such  as vitamin C, vitamin E, folate, omega -3 fatty acids, and polyphenols 
are known to reduce oxidative stress and promote genomic stability, thereby slowing the 
telomer e shortening  process.  
6.  Physical Activity: Regular physical activity is among the most potent lifestyle interventions 
for maintaining telomere length. Exercise reduces systemic inflammation, enhances 
antioxidant defen ces, improves insulin sensitivity, and lowers stress hormone levels —all of 
which are beneficial for telomere preservation  [18,19 ]. Studies reveal that individuals 
engaging in moderate -to-vigorous physical activity have significantly longer telomeres 
compared to sedentary individuals. Furthermore, physical fitness is inversely associated 
with cellular aging markers, reinforcing the role of exercise in promoting healthy  longevity.  
Chronic Stress: High levels of psychological stress and poor stress -coping mechanisms are 
strongly associated with accelerated telomere erosion. Stress activates the hypothalamic -
pituitary -adrenal (HPA) axis, increasing cortisol levels and oxidative damage . 
7. Sleep Quality and Duration : Sleep is a critical yet often overlooked determinant of telomere 
dynamics. Poor sleep quality, inadequate duration (<6 hours per night), and disorders such 
as insomnia and sleep apnea contribute to systemic inflammation, impaired glucose 
metabolism, and el evated cortisol levels —all of which promote telomere shortening  [20,21] . 
Studies show that individuals with poor sleep hygiene tend to have significantly shorter 
telomeres than those with consistent, restful sleep. Furthermore, sleep disruptions can 
exacerbate the negative effects of other risk factors such as obesity and stress, creating a 
compounding effect on cellular aging.  
I.III India’s Lifestyle Divide and Its Molecular Consequences   
India, home to over 1.4 billion people, is not a monolith in terms of health, habits, or environment. Its 
states and union territories exhibit wide disparities in lifestyle patterns, healthcare infrastructure, 
pollution levels, education, and economic development. From the high -altitude Himalayan regions 
with lower pollution but harsher climates, to metropolitan hubs plagued with stress and poor air 
quality, the conditions under which Indians live —and age —are vastly heterogeneous.  
Despite this diversity, health assessments across states have mostly been limited to life expectancy, 
disease burden, and fertility rates, which are important but incomplete indicators of population health. 
Biological aging, as represented by telomere attr ition, offers a novel and deeper insight into how 
lifestyle, policy, and culture interplay to shape health trajectories at the molecular level.  
This research paper introduces and develops the concept of a “Telomeres Divide” —a molecular 
boundary emerging from differing lifestyles and health behavio urs across Indian states. By analy sing 
lifestyle -related indicators and environmental exposures specific to each state, we aim to estimate the 
relative rate of telomere attrition, and rank the states accordingly.  
In doing so, this study hopes to contribute to a data -driven aging policy framework for India —where 
aging is not just about longer lives, but about longer, healthier lives.

 II. Algorithm Design and Implementation  
This study adopts a multi -parametric scoring and ranking methodology to estimate and compare the 
rate of telomere attrition across Indian states based on lifestyle and environmental determinants 
known to influence telomere biology. The analysis is divided into seven  primary  phases:  
1. Identification of Telomere -Influencing Factors  
Based on a comprehensive review of existing biomedical literature, we identified eight major factors 
that significantly contribute to telomere shortening  (Refer to Fig.2) : 
• Air Pollution Exposure (PM 2.5, AQI)  
• Tobacco Use  
• Obesity and Metabolic Health  
• Diet and Nutrition Quality  
• Physical Activity Levels  
• Chronic Stress Indicators  
• Sleep Quality and Duration  
• Public Health and Socioeconomic  Indicators  
The analysis considers three key factors  from the above mentioned —air pollution exposure, tobacco 
use, and obesity —as they are major contributors to telomere shortening  and due to the availability of 
reliable state -wise data, while sufficient data for other relevant factors was not consistently available  
across all states.

 4. Factor Weight Assignment  
 
Each factor was assigned a weight based on its relative impact on telomere attrition, as validated by 
peer-reviewed  meta -analyses . 
 
1. Air Pollution (PM 2.5) – 45% Weight  
 
Airborne fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) is one of the most potent environmental contributors to 
cellular aging. Studies have shown that chronic exposure to PM 2.5 induces oxidative stress, damages 
DNA, and leads to accelerated telomere erosion.  
A longitudinal study published in Environmental Health Perspectives  (Hou et al., 2012) demonstrated 
a negative correlation between PM 2.5 levels and leukocyte telomere length, particularly in urban 
populations  [10]. The mechanism primarily involves the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), 
which damage telomeric DNA and inhibit telomerase, the enzyme responsible for telomere 
maintenance. The World Health Organization has also acknowledged air pollution as a m ajor 
modifiable risk factor for non -communi cable diseases that are closely tied to telomere biology.  
 
2. Tobacco Use – 35% Weight   
 
Tobacco smoke contains over 7,000 chemicals, many of which are pro -oxidants and carcinogens. Its 
impact on telomeres has been validated across multiple epidemiological and clinical studies. Smokers 
have been shown to have significantly shorter telomeres co mpared to non -smokers, independent of 
age, BMI, and socioeconomic status.  
A major meta -analysis (Valdes et al., The Lancet , 2005) confirmed that tobacco use is associated with 
a reduction in telomere length equivalent to several years of biological aging  [12]. This is attributed to 
the direct induction of oxidative stress and chronic systemic inflammation, both of which contribute to 
the shortening of telomeric DNA with each cell division.  
 
3. Obesity – 20% Weight  
 
Obesity, particularly visceral or central obesity, is a systemic condition linked to metabolic 
dysregulation, low -grade inflammation, and insulin resistance — all of which accelerate cellular 
aging.  
Research published in journals like Obesity Reviews  and The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & 
Metabolism  has shown that individuals with higher BMI and waist circumference have significantly 
shorter telomeres, suggesting a direct relationship between adiposity and biological age. The 
biological underpinnings involve chronic activation of inflammatory pathway s (e.g., NF -κB), 
increased oxidative stress, and dysregulated telomerase activity.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5. Calculation of T elomere Attrition Inde x (TAI)  for each State  
The formula used for its calculation is:  
 
  TAI (S) = ∑ 𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑛
𝑖=1  
  
 𝑤𝑖: Weight assigned to ith factor  
𝑠𝑖 : Normalised score of ith factor for the state S  
  n : Number of factors

 III. Empirical Validation of the Rank -List 
 
The rank-list generated through this index closely aligns with empirical trends observed across Indian 
regions , which validates the accuracy of the rank -list.  
 
1. High -Risk States (Low TAI i.e. High Telomere Attrition Risk)  
 
• Delhi ranks at the top with the lowest  TAI, indicating highest telomere attrition — this is 
well-supported by extensive air pollution data. Delhi consistently records PM 2.5 levels 
exceeding WHO limits by over 10 times, making it biologically plausible for residents to 
exhibit accelerated cellular aging  [22,23] . 
• Tripura, Mizoram, Uttar Pradesh, and Haryana also appear among the highest -risk states. 
These regions are characterized by:  
o Extremely high tobacco usage (NFHS -5 and GATS report Tripura and Mizoram 
among top tobacco -consuming states)  [24,25] . 
o Poor air quality in northern plains like UP and Haryana  [23]. 
o Increasing obesity rates in both rural and urban sectors, especially in north -central 
India [24]. 
 
2.  Middle -Risk States (Moderate TAI)  
 
• States like West Bengal, Odisha, Punjab, Chhattisgarh, and Madhya Pradesh fall into the 
middle -risk tier. This aligns with:  
o Moderate pollution exposure (urban pockets with industrial activity but large rural 
buffers)  [23]. 
o Rising lifestyle -related disorders like obesity and hypertension  [24].  
o Variable tobacco use, especially smokeless forms in eastern India  [25]. 
 
3.  Low -Risk States (High TAI → Low Telomere Attrition Risk)  
 
• Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Himachal Pradesh rank highest in TAI, indicating the 
least biological risk for telomere shortening.  
o Kerala: Known for exceptional public health indicators, low tobacco usage, high 
literacy, and robust primary care access  [24]. 
o Himachal Pradesh and Tamil Nadu: Cleaner air, lower smoking prevalence, and 
active public health outreach  [23,25 ]. 
o Karnataka: Balanced urbanization with relatively low air pollution levels outside 
metro areas  [23]. 
 
4. Concordance with Epidemiological Trends  
 
Cross -validation with known burden of non -communicable diseases (NCDs), as reported in 
India’s National Health Profile , also provides robust epidemiological validation  [26,28] . 
 
o High -risk TAI states report higher instances of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and 
respiratory illness — all associated with telomere attrition  [27,28] . 
o States with high TAI often report better NCD outcomes, longer life expectancy, and 
better access to preventive care  [26]. 
 
Note: By incorporating additional lifestyle factors such as diet quality, stress levels, sleep duration 
and quality, and physical activity patterns, the Telomere Attrition Index (TAI) can be recalibrated to 
enable a more comprehensive and nuanced assessment of t elomere attrition risk.  However, due to the 
unavailability of consistent and state -wise data for these variables across India, they could not be 
included in the present analysis .

 IV. Conclusion  
 
This study presents a novel, evidence -based framework to quantify telomere attrition risk across 
Indian states through the construction of a Telomere Attrition Index (TAI). By focusing on three 
primary determinants —air pollution, tobacco use, and obesity —the analysis reveals significant 
regional disparities in biological aging, effectively mapping a “Telomere Divide” within the country.  
The findings underscore how environmental and lifestyle factors, though modifiable, are deeply 
rooted in socio -economic and policy contexts, disproportionately accelerating cellular aging in certain 
populations. High -risk states such as Delhi, Tripura, and  Uttar Pradesh face a convergence of harmful 
exposures that elevate their biological vulnerability, while others benefit from more protective 
conditions.  It also establishes a replicable model for assessing aging risks in other low - and middle -
income setti ngs.
