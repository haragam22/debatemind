""The proposed PDF file size limit will disproportionately harm vulnerable individuals, such as students, seniors, and people with disabilities, who rely on digital documents for essential information and services. By imposing a draconian file size cap, we risk denying them access to critical resources, exacerbating existing inequities and isolating them from the digital world. This policy will have a punitive, rather than a progressive, impact on our most vulnerable members, undermining the very principles of inclusion and accessibility that our digital infrastructure should uphold.""","Here's a concise rebuttal with evidence:

""While empathy is essential, we must not let emotional appeals cloud our judgment. The proposed file size limit is a necessary measure to address the growing concern of digital clutter and information overload. Research has shown that excessive file sizes can lead to slower load times, decreased efficiency, and even security vulnerabilities (Source: Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency). By capping file sizes, we can ensure that essential documents remain accessible while preventing the proliferation of bloated, unoptimized files. Moreover, digital equity initiatives, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) guidelines, already provide clear standards for accessible digital content. We should focus on implementing and enforcing these existing regulations rather than creating a new, untested policy that may inadvertently create new barriers for some users. Let's prioritize practical solutions that promote digital efficiency, security, and inclusivity.""",1,-0.5999999999999996
